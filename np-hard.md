# NP-Hard Problems

## Definition and Properties

### Formal Definition
A problem H is NP-hard if every problem L in NP can be polynomial-time reduced to H. Note that:
- H does not need to be in NP
- H may not have verifiable solutions
- H may not even be decidable

### Key Properties
1. At least as hard as NP-complete problems
2. May be harder than NP-complete problems
3. No known polynomial-time solutions
4. Often optimization versions of NP-complete problems

## Relationship with Other Classes

### 1. NP-Complete vs NP-Hard
- NP-complete = NP-hard âˆ© NP
- NP-hard problems may not be in NP
- All NP-complete problems are NP-hard

### 2. Beyond NP
- Some NP-hard problems are undecidable
- Some belong to higher complexity classes
- Examples in #P, PSPACE, and beyond

## Common NP-Hard Problems

### 1. Optimization Problems
```python
class TSPOptimization:
    """
    Traveling Salesman Problem (Optimization)
    Find minimum cost tour visiting all cities
    """
    def __init__(self, distances):
        self.distances = distances
        self.n = len(distances)

    def evaluate_tour(self, tour):
        """Calculate total tour cost"""
        cost = 0
        for i in range(self.n):
            cost += self.distances[tour[i]][tour[(i+1)%self.n]]
        return cost

    def nearest_neighbor(self):
        """Greedy heuristic solution"""
        tour = [0]
        unvisited = set(range(1, self.n))

        while unvisited:
            curr = tour[-1]
            next_city = min(unvisited,
                key=lambda x: self.distances[curr][x])
            tour.append(next_city)
            unvisited.remove(next_city)

        return tour, self.evaluate_tour(tour)
```

### 2. Counting Problems
```python
def count_hamiltonians(graph):
    """
    Count number of Hamiltonian cycles
    #P-hard problem
    """
    n = len(graph)
    count = 0

    def backtrack(path, visited):
        nonlocal count
        if len(path) == n:
            if graph[path[-1]][path[0]]:
                count += 1
            return

        curr = path[-1]
        for next_v in range(n):
            if (not visited[next_v] and
                graph[curr][next_v]):
                visited[next_v] = True
                path.append(next_v)
                backtrack(path, visited)
                path.pop()
                visited[next_v] = False

    visited = [False] * n
    visited[0] = True
    backtrack([0], visited)
    return count
```

### 3. Function Problems
```python
def chromatic_polynomial(graph):
    """
    Count proper colorings with k colors
    #P-hard function problem
    """
    def count_colorings(k):
        """Count k-colorings recursively"""
        if not graph.edges:
            return k ** len(graph.vertices)

        # Contract edge
        e = graph.edges[0]
        g1 = graph.contract_edge(e)
        # Delete edge
        g2 = graph.delete_edge(e)

        return (count_colorings(g1, k) -
                count_colorings(g2, k))

    return count_colorings
```

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Exact Algorithms
```python
def branch_and_bound_tsp(graph):
    """
    Branch and bound for TSP
    - Explores all possibilities
    - Uses bounds to prune search space
    """
    n = len(graph)
    best_tour = None
    best_cost = float('inf')

    def bound(path, unvisited):
        # Lower bound calculation
        return min_possible_cost(path, unvisited)

    def search(path, unvisited, cost):
        nonlocal best_tour, best_cost
        if not unvisited:
            total_cost = cost + graph[path[-1]][path[0]]
            if total_cost < best_cost:
                best_cost = total_cost
                best_tour = path[:]
            return

        for next_city in unvisited:
            if bound(path + [next_city],
                    unvisited - {next_city}) < best_cost:
                search(path + [next_city],
                      unvisited - {next_city},
                      cost + graph[path[-1]][next_city])

    initial_path = [0]
    unvisited = set(range(1, n))
    search(initial_path, unvisited, 0)
    return best_tour, best_cost
```

### 2. Approximation Algorithms

    """
    1.5-approximation for metric TSP

    """
    def minimum_spanning_tree(graph):
        # Prim's algorithm
        pass

    def minimum_weight_matching(vertices):
        # Edmonds' algorithm
        pass

    def eulerian_circuit(graph):
        # Hierholzer's algorithm
        pass

    # Main algorithm steps
    mst = minimum_spanning_tree(distances)
    odd_vertices = get_odd_degree_vertices(mst)
    matching = minimum_weight_matching(odd_vertices)
    euler_graph = combine_graphs(mst, matching)
    euler_circuit = eulerian_circuit(euler_graph)

    return shortcut_tour(euler_circuit)
```

### 3. Metaheuristics
```python
def simulated_annealing(problem, init_temp=100):
    """
    General metaheuristic for NP-hard problems
    """
    current = problem.random_solution()
    best = current
    temp = init_temp

    while temp > 0.1:
        neighbor = problem.get_neighbor(current)
        delta = problem.evaluate(neighbor) - \
                problem.evaluate(current)

        if (delta > 0 or
            random.random() < math.exp(delta/temp)):
            current = neighbor
            if problem.evaluate(current) > \
               problem.evaluate(best):
                best = current

        temp *= 0.95
    return best
```

### 4. Integer Programming

    """
    Mixed Integer Linear Programming approach
    Using branch and cut
    """
    model = create_model()

    # Add variables
    x = model.addVars(problem.n, vtype='B')
    y = model.addVars(problem.m, vtype='C')

    # Add constraints
    add_problem_constraints(model, x, y)

    # Set objective
    model.setObjective(problem.objective(x, y),
                      GRB.MINIMIZE)

    # Solve
    model.optimize()

    if size < 20:
        return "exact"
    elif special:
        return "specialized"
    elif size < 100:
        return "metaheuristic"
    else:
        return "approximation"
```

    lower = problem.lower_bound()
    upper = problem.upper_bound()

    return {
        'value': value,
        'gap': (upper - value) / value,
        'relative': (value - lower) / lower
    }
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
```python

        pass

    def optimize_memory():
        # Optimize memory usage
        pass

    def parallelize():
        # Parallel implementation

    # Analyze and optimize
    hotspots = profile_run()
    optimize_memory()
