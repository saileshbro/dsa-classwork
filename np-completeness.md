# NP-Completeness

## Introduction

NP-completeness is a fundamental concept in computational complexity theory that helps classify computational problems according to their inherent difficulty.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Complexity Classes

#### P (Polynomial Time)
- Problems solvable in polynomial time
- Example: Sorting, shortest paths
- Considered "tractable" problems

#### NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)
- Problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time
- Includes both P and NP-complete problems
- Example: Boolean satisfiability, clique problem

#### NP-Complete
- Hardest problems in NP
- All NP problems reduce to them
- Examples:
  - Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)
  - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
  - Clique Problem
  - Vertex Cover
  - Hamiltonian Cycle

### 2. Polynomial-Time Reductions
- Method to prove NP-completeness
- Shows problem A is at least as hard as problem B
- Properties:
  - Transitive
  - Preserves polynomial-time solvability
  - Used in NP-completeness proofs

## Key Problems

### 1. Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)
- First proven NP-complete problem (Cook-Levin Theorem)
- Input: Boolean formula
- Question: Is there an assignment making formula true?
- See implementation in `boolean-satisfiability-problem/main.py`

### 2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Classic NP-complete optimization problem
- Input: Graph with weighted edges
- Goal: Find minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle
- See implementation in `traveling-salesman/main.py`

### 3. Hamiltonian Cycle Problem
- Finding a cycle visiting each vertex exactly once
- Reduces to TSP with weights {0,1}
- See implementation in `hemaltenian-cycle-problem/main.py`

### 4. Clique Problem
- Finding complete subgraphs of size k
- Important in social network analysis
- See implementation in `clique_implementations.py`

## Coping with NP-Completeness

### 1. Approximation Algorithms
- Trade optimality for efficiency
- Provide performance guarantees
- Examples:
  - TSP: 2-approximation for metric instances
  - Vertex Cover: 2-approximation
  - Clique: O(n/log²n)-approximation

### 2. Parameterized Algorithms
- Efficient when parameter is small
- Fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)
- Examples:
  - k-Vertex Cover
  - k-Clique
  - k-Path

### 3. Heuristic Approaches
- No guarantees but often practical
- Local search, genetic algorithms
- Examples in our implementations:
  - Las Vegas algorithm for N-Queens
  - Local search for TSP
  - Genetic algorithm for clique

## Proving NP-Completeness

### General Strategy
1. Show problem is in NP
2. Choose known NP-complete problem
3. Construct polynomial reduction
4. Prove correctness

### Example: Clique to Independent Set
```
Reduction outline:
1. Given graph G, create complement G'
2. k-clique in G ⟺ k-independent set in G'
3. Transform solution back
```
