# Computational Complexity Classes

## P (Polynomial Time)
- Problems that can be solved by a deterministic algorithm in polynomial time
- Solution can be found and verified in polynomial time
- Examples:
  1. Sorting algorithms (Quicksort, Mergesort) - O(n log n)
  2. Binary Search - O(log n)
  3. Matrix Multiplication - O(n³)
  4. Finding Shortest Path using Dijkstra's Algorithm - O(V² + E)

## NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time)
- Problems where a solution can be verified in polynomial time
- Finding a solution may take exponential time
- All P problems are in NP, but not vice versa (unless P = NP)
- Examples:
  1. Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)
  2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
  3. Subset Sum Problem
  4. Graph Coloring Problem

## NP-Complete
- Hardest problems in NP
- If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then all NP problems can be
- A problem is NP-complete if:
  1. It is in NP
  2. Every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time
- Examples:
  1. 3-SAT (Boolean satisfiability with 3 variables per clause)
  2. Hamilton Cycle Problem
  3. Vertex Cover Problem
  4. N-Queens Problem

## NP-Hard
- Problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP
- May not be in NP themselves
- Don't necessarily have verifiable solutions in polynomial time
- Examples:
  1. Halting Problem
  2. Traveling Salesman Optimization Problem
  3. Graph Isomorphism Problem
  4. Knapsack Optimization Problem

## Relationships
```
P ⊆ NP ⊆ NP-Hard
     ∩
NP-Complete
```

## Key Differences
1. P problems: Can be both solved and verified quickly
2. NP problems: Can be verified quickly, but may not be solved quickly
3. NP-Complete problems: Hardest problems in NP
4. NP-Hard problems: At least as hard as NP-Complete problems, but may not be in NP

## Real-world Applications
- **P**: Most everyday computational tasks (sorting, searching, basic graph algorithms)

    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
Time Complexity: O(log n)

def subset_sum_exists(numbers, target_sum):
    def backtrack(index, current_sum):
        if current_sum == target_sum:
            return True
        if index >= len(numbers) or current_sum > target_sum:
            return False

        # Include current number
        if backtrack(index + 1, current_sum + numbers[index]):
            return True

        # Exclude current number
        return backtrack(0, 0)
```
Verification: O(n), Solution Finding: O(2ⁿ)

    return True

def graph_coloring(graph, m, vertex, colors):
    if vertex == len(graph):
        return True

    for color in range(1, m + 1):
        if is_safe(graph, colors, vertex, color):
            colors[vertex] = color
            if graph_coloring(graph, m, vertex + 1, colors):
                return True
            colors[vertex] = 0
    return False
```
Verification: O(V²), Solution Finding: O(mᵛ)

    n = len(graph)
    dp = {}

    def solve(mask, pos):
        if mask == (1 << n) - 1:
            return graph[pos][0]

        key = (mask, pos)
        if key in dp:
            return dp[key]

        ans = float('inf')
        for city in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1 << city)):
                new_ans = graph[pos][city] + solve(mask | (1 << city), city)
                ans = min(ans, new_ans)

        dp[key] = ans
        return ans

    return solve(1, 0)  # Start from city 0
```

    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    pivot = random.choice(arr)  # Random pivot selection
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

        return True
    if n < 2 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False

    def check(a, d, n, s):
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1:
            return True
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            if x == n - 1:
                return True
            x = (x * x) % n
        return x == n - 1

    s = 0
    d = n - 1
    while d % 2 == 0:
        s += 1
        d //= 2

    for _ in range(k):
        a = random.randrange(2, n - 1)
        if not check(a, d, n, s):
            return False
    return True

# Non-deterministic Algorithms

Non-deterministic algorithms are theoretical constructs that help in understanding complexity classes, particularly in the context of NP problems.

## Definition

A non-deterministic algorithm is a theoretical model of computation where:
- The algorithm can make guesses during execution
- Each guess creates a new branch of computation
- The algorithm accepts if any branch leads to acceptance

## Key Concepts

1. **Guessing Stage**
   - Makes arbitrary choices
   - Creates multiple parallel paths of execution
   - Each path represents a potential solution

2. **Verification Stage**
   - Deterministically checks if the guessed solution is correct
   - Must complete in polynomial time for NP problems
   - Only one path needs to lead to acceptance

## Characteristics

1. **Parallelism**
   - Conceptually executes all possible paths simultaneously
   - Can be viewed as infinite parallelism
   - Not physically realizable

2. **Time Complexity**
   - Measured by the length of the longest path
   - Ignores the number of parallel paths
   - Critical for defining complexity classes

## Applications in Complexity Theory

1. **NP Class Definition**
   - Problems solvable by non-deterministic algorithms in polynomial time
   - Encompasses both P and NP-complete problems
   - Central to the P vs NP question

2. **Proof Techniques**

# Non-Deterministic Algorithms

## Definition
A non-deterministic algorithm is one that can exhibit different behaviors on different runs for the same input, where the specific behavior is determined by chance or by an uncontrolled internal choice mechanism.

## Characteristics

   - Can pursue multiple computation paths simultaneously
   - May give different outputs on different runs
   - Not guaranteed to produce the same result each time
