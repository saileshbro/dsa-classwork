# Vertex Cover Problem

## Problem Definition

A vertex cover of an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a subset of vertices V' ⊆ V such that each edge in E has at least one endpoint in V'. The Vertex Cover problem asks to find a vertex cover of minimum size.

## NP-Completeness

### Proof Outline
1. Show problem is in NP:
   - Certificate: Set of vertices
   - Verification: Check if all edges covered in polynomial time

2. Reduce from 3-SAT:
   - For each variable x, create vertices x and ¬x
   - For each clause, create gadget ensuring satisfaction
   - Polynomial-time transformation

## Algorithms

### 1. Exact Solutions

#### Branch and Bound
```python
def branch_bound_vertex_cover(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    best_cover = set(range(n))  # Start with all vertices

    def bound(cover, uncovered_edges):
        return len(cover) + len(uncovered_edges) // 2

    def branch(cover, edges):
        nonlocal best_cover

        if not edges:  # Valid cover found
            if len(cover) < len(best_cover):
                best_cover = cover.copy()
            return

        if bound(cover, edges) >= len(best_cover):
            return  # Prune branch

        # Take edge endpoints
        e = edges[0]
        remaining = edges[1:]

        # Try first endpoint
        new_cover = cover | {e[0]}
        new_edges = [edge for edge in remaining
                    if e[0] not in edge]
        branch(new_cover, new_edges)

        # Try second endpoint
        new_cover = cover | {e[1]}
        new_edges = [edge for edge in remaining
                    if e[1] not in edge]
        branch(new_cover, new_edges)

    branch(set(), list(graph.edges))
    return best_cover
```

### 2. Approximation Algorithms

#### 2-Approximation (Greedy)
```python
def greedy_vertex_cover(graph):
    cover = set()
    edges = list(graph.edges)

    while edges:
        # Pick any edge
        u, v = edges[0]
        cover.add(u)
        cover.add(v)

        # Remove covered edges
        edges = [(x, y) for (x, y) in edges
                if x != u and x != v and
                   y != u and y != v]

    return cover
```

#### Linear Programming Relaxation
```python
def lp_vertex_cover(graph):
    """
    2-approximation using LP relaxation
    Requires linear programming solver
    """
    n = len(graph)
    c = [1] * n  # Objective coefficients

    # Create constraints matrix
    A = []
    b = []
    for edge in graph.edges:
        row = [0] * n
        row[edge[0]] = 1
        row[edge[1]] = 1
        A.append(row)
        b.append(1)

    # Solve LP relaxation
    x = solve_lp(c, A, b, bounds=(0, 1))

    # Round solution
    return {v for v in range(n) if x[v] >= 0.5}
```

### 3. Heuristic Approaches

#### Local Search
```python
def local_search_vertex_cover(graph,
                            max_iterations=1000):
    n = len(graph)
    cover = set(range(n))  # Start with all vertices

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        improved = False

        # Try removing vertices
        for v in list(cover):
            # Check if still valid after removal
            if all(u in cover or w in cover
                  for (u, w) in graph.edges
                  if u == v or w == v):
                cover.remove(v)
                improved = True

        if not improved:
            break

    return cover
```

                        pop_size=100,
                        generations=1000):
    n = len(graph)

    def fitness(cover):
        if not all(u in cover or v in cover
                  for (u, v) in graph.edges):
            return float('inf')
        return len(cover)

    def crossover(p1, p2):
        child = set()
        for v in range(n):
            if v in p1 and v in p2:
                child.add(v)
            elif v in p1 or v in p2:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    child.add(v)
        return child

    # Initialize population
    population = []
    while len(population) < pop_size:
        cover = {v for v in range(n)
                if random.random() < 0.5}
        if all(u in cover or v in cover
              for (u, v) in graph.edges):
            population.append(cover)

    best_cover = min(population, key=fitness)

    for _ in range(generations):
        # Selection and crossover
        new_pop = []
        while len(new_pop) < pop_size:
            p1, p2 = random.sample(population, 2)
            child = crossover(p1, p2)

            # Mutation
            if random.random() < 0.1:
                v = random.randrange(n)
                if v in child:
                    child.remove(v)
                else:
                    child.add(v)

            if all(u in child or v in child
                  for (u, v) in graph.edges):
                new_pop.append(child)

        population = new_pop

        # Update best solution
        current_best = min(population, key=fitness)
        if fitness(current_best) < fitness(best_cover):
            best_cover = current_best

    return best_cover
```
